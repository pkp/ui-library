# API Interactions

OJS/OMP/OPS already have substantial [Rest API interface](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/api/ojs/3.4), well covered with documentation.

To interact with the API there are handy composables available to simplify the process.

## Compose URL

Once you know which API endpoint you want to interact with, its necessary to create correct API URL based on current context. Use [useApiUrl](?path=/docs/composables-useapiurl--docs) composable to achieve that.

## Making HTTP requests

To make HTTP request to the API, best is use dedicated [useFetch](?path=/docs/composables-usefetch--docs) or [useFetchPaginated](?path=/docs/composables-usefetchpaginated--docs) composables. Refer to their documentation for examples.

For more custom use-cases its possible to use directly underlying [ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch) package.
