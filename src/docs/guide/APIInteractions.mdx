# API Interactions

OJS, OMP, and OPS already have a substantial [Rest API interface](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/api/ojs/3.4).

To interact with the API there are handy composables available to simplify the process.

## Compose URL

Once you know which API endpoint you want to interact with, it's necessary to create the correct API URL based on the current context (journal, press, or server). Use the [useUrl](?path=/docs/composables-useurl--docs) composable to achieve that.

## Making HTTP requests

To make HTTP request to the API, it's best to use the [useFetch](?path=/docs/composables-usefetch--docs) or [useFetchPaginated](?path=/docs/composables-usefetchpaginated--docs) composables. Refer to their documentation for examples.

For more custom use-cases it's possible to directly use the underlying [ofetch](https://github.com/unjs/ofetch) package.
