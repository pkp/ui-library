# Introduction - TailwindCSS

Going forward we are adopting [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) framework for styling our Admin interface.

## Recomendations

- Highly recommend to use [tailwindcss cheatsheet](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet) to quickly find classes you need, especially if you are already familiar with css.
- If you don't have much experience with writing CSS - tailwind should easy out that experience.
- Check following pages for properties that are we hand-picked to fit our styling - [colors](../?path=/docs/guide-style-colors--docs), [fonts](../?path=/docs/guide-style-fonts--docs), [shadows](../?path=/docs/guide-style-shadows--docs) and [radiuses](../?path=/docs/guide-style-radius--docs).
- All other properties comes from tailwind defaults. Therefore you can directly use the values you find in [cheatsheet](https://nerdcave.com/tailwind-cheat-sheet) or in [tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first).

## Migration path

- Using tailwindCSS make sense for building new components or when doing significant changes of existing components.

## Motivation

- Main motivation is to have good primitives to create consistent design, without creating own solution. TailwindCSS does that for us.
- TailwindCSS is easy to configure to adjust to our design (fonts, colors), while providing great defaults in other areas (margins, paddings)
