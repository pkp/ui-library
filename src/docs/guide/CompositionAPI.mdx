# Vue Composition API

In version 3.5 we migrated our ui-library to new Vue3 version, which introduces new [Composition API](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#composition-api) as more flexible alternative to existing Options API.

## Composition API

Composition API builds on exactly same principles as the Options API that we are used to from Vue 2. State management still consist of **state** , **computed** properties and **methods** that are updating the **state**. Only the syntax is more flexible.

It might take bit getting used to to new syntax, but it will reward us is with significantly better flexibility compared to mixins, which comes very handy in complex application like we have.

Best learning source is Vue.js [documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html), where you can easily explore syntax differences between Options API and Composition API.

## Composables

Composables are replacements for mixins. More details to come about the composables that we provide instead of existing mixins. In general these will be useful to handle all common tasks, like interacting with API, translation or manupulating forms.

## How to organise the code

Even though it seems that Composition API is lacking organizational structure, it actually gives possibility of organise the code by individual features. Every feature usually consist of some state, computed properties and methods. Good example is `SubmissionsPageStore.js`.

Also it should be easy to quickly understand how the Page works when reading the business logic in store. If its too long or/and contains long functions its indication that some of the features should be moved to individual feature composables. These can be imported to the store and connected with rest of the features in the store. This helps to get good understanding how things works together and its always possible to dive in into details in individual composables if needed.

## Refs vs reactive

If you want to dive deep and understand all details between using `ref()` vs `reactive()` when creating reactive state in Composable API, you can check out [official documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals) or detailed [blog post](https://mokkapps.de/blog/ref-vs-reactive-what-to-choose-using-vue-3-composition-api).

But its not really necessary, as we follow [official recommendation](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals#limitations-of-reactive), which aligns with my personal experience as well, which is just always use `ref()` when defining state.

```javascript
import {ref} from 'vue';

// defining state
const isLoading = ref(false);
const items = ref([]);

// modifying the state, using the .value
items.value.push({title: 'a'});
isLoading.value = true;
```
