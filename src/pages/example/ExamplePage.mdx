# Example page

These principles applies for version 3.5 and higher, when building new pages or making significant changes to existing ones.

## Folder structure

```
ui-library/src/pages/example
  /** Main page files */
  ExamplePage.vue
  ExamplePage.store.js
  ExamplePage.mdx
  ExamplePage.stories.js

  /** Page specific components to organise the page to smaller pieces */
  ExampleCounter.vue
  ExampleSubmissions.vue

  /** Complex "sub page" that deserve own store, to be added later */
  ExampleSummaryModal.vue
  ExampleSummaryStore.js
```

## Page template included in Page component.

To simplify the developer experience when creating Pages, we are moving from mix of smarty and Vue.js to use pure Vue.js components, which have templates as part of the component.

There is dedicated [guide](../?path=/docs/guide-smarty-vs-vue-js--docs) to help with transition from some smarty features to vue.js

## State management

State management is intentionally done via [pinia store](../?path=/docs/guide-vue3--docs#pinia-store). Follow the link to get more details.

## Server side configuration

On initial page load, there is still opportunity to pass JS object from PHP to the Vue.js.

This might include things like:

- Form structure configuration, as we do configure forms on PHP side
- API urls that currently can be constructed on PHP side
- Any configuration which needs to be passed just once on page load

## Api Mocking

While working on new components or pages, its necessary to mock any API related communication. Storybook provides simple mechanism how to setup the mocks in the stories file.
