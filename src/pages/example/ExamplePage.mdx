# Example page

These principles applies for version 3.5 and higher, when building new pages or making significant changes to existing ones.

## Folder structure

```
ui-library/src/pages/example
  /** Main page files */
  ExamplePage.vue
  ExamplePage.store.js
  ExamplePage.mdx
  ExamplePage.stories.js

  /** Page specific components to organise the page to smaller pieces */
  ExampleCounter.vue
  ExampleSubmissions.vue

  /** Complex "sub page" that deserve own store, to be added later */
  ExampleSummaryModal.vue
  ExampleSummaryStore.js
```

## Server side configuration (expressed as Page props)

<ArgTypes />

## Api Mocking

While working on new components or pages, its necessary to mock any API related communication. Storybook provides simple mechanism how to setup the mocks in the stories file.
