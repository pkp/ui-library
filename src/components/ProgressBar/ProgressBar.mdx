# ProgressBar

## Usage

Use the `ProgressBar` component to show the progress of file uploads or other tasks which are not completed in a single request. Do not use a `ProgressBar` for long-running tasks when you will not be able to update the progress until the task is complete. Use the **Spinner** instead.

<Primary />
<Controls />
<Stories />
