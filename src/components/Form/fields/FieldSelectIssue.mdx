# FieldSelectIssue

## Usage

A special component for selecting an issue. When a publication is scheduled or published, this field will no longer show the selection options and will instead show a message indicating the issue it was scheduled or published in.

In the example above, the "Assign to Issue" button will not work. This depends on the old JavaScript framework within the application.
