# FieldOptions

## Usage

Use this component for selecting one or more options from a list. If the list of items is short, use this component instead of a [`FieldSelect`](../?path=/docs/forms-fieldselect--docs).

## Confirm fields and boolean values

When using this component as a confirmation field, the `value` prop passed to the field should be `true` or `false`. This differs from the field's normal `value` type, which is an array.

## Orderable options

Pass the `isOrderable` prop when you want the order of options to be preserved. When options are reordered, their position in the `value` array will be updated.
