# FieldAutosuggestPreset

## Usage

This is an implementation of [FieldBaseAutosuggest](#/component/Form/fields/FieldBaseAutosuggest) that does not require a request to an API endpoint. Instead, the list of options are passed in as a prop.

```html
<FieldAutosuggestPreset ... :options="[ { value: 1, label: "Articles" }, {
value: 2, label: "Reviews" }, ]">
```

Use this component when there is a limited number of possible suggestions and a simple match with the `label` and `value` are sufficient.

<Controls />
