# FielBaseAutosuggest

## Usage

This is a base component and should not be used directly. Instead, create a new component that extends `FieldBaseAutosuggest` to create an autosuggest field.

Every component that extends `FieldBaseAutosuggest` must provide a `setSuggestions` method which will convert the API response to a suggestion.

```js
import FieldBaseAutosuggest from './FieldBaseAutosuggest.vue';

export default {
	extends: FieldBaseAutosuggest,
	methods: {
		setSuggestions(newItems) {
			this.suggestions = newItems.map((item) => {
				return {
					value: item.id,
					label: item.title,
				};
			});
		},
	},
};
```

The `value` is submitted with the form.

## Inline Labels

Do not use `isLabelInline` unless a designer has recommended this approach. A form that uses inline labels should be designed specifically to support them.

## Implementations

The following autosuggest fields are available to be used.

- `FieldAutosuggestPreset` can be used to when the options can be preset instead of requiring a request to the REST API.
- `FieldControlledVocab` can be used to enter metadata such as keywords and subjects.
- `FieldSelectSubmissions` can be used to find and select submissions.
