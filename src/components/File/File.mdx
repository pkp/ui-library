# File

## Usage

Use this component to display a file in a consistent format across all components.

Show the `id` when it may be useful. For example, show it to editors when promoting files, because they may track the file ids in a separate system. But the `id` is not needed when an author makes a new submission, because the file ids won't yet have been used to track files or discuss them.
