# ButtonRow

## Usage

Use this component to display a row of buttons or other actions. The actions in a `<ButtonRow>` will always be displayed at the end of the row, in order to be consistent across the application. This will be the right side in right-to-left languages and the left side in left-to-right languages. The `end` slot should be used to place alternate actions, like a back button, at the start of the row. All primary actions should be at the end of the row.
