# Dialog

Dialog purpose is to display simple feedback like success and error messages. Or request confirmation for example before deleting content.

## Usage

Dialog are opened via method `openDialog` from [useModal](../?path=/docs/composables-usemodal--docs#opensidemodal) composable. Check out the props description for details.

## Styling

The style of the modal can be changed by passing the prop `modalStyle`. It accepts the following values:

- **`primary`**: A modal style that uses the primary color scheme. Use this for informational dialogs or confirmation modals that don't involve negative actions. This is the default style used when the modal is invoked via the composable API for the Dialog component.
- **`negative`**: Indicates a negative state, typically for error messages or alerts. It should also be used for confirming negative actions like deleting or removing items that may be irreversible.
- **`success`**: Represents a positive state, often used for success notifications.
- **` basic`**: The standard modal style, which has no special border styling. This style is applied by default in the legacy PHP implementation of the Dialog component, if no value is specified.

## Accessibility

To correctly handle accessibility (title, description) and focus management - [headless-ui](https://headlessui.com) library is used.
