## Usage

This component preview is only partially functional. The component uses the server to save and sync data, so information in the review step is not updated based on input from earlier steps. Also, it is not possible to add contributors, upload files, or make use of the autosave features.

The `<SubmissionWizardPage>` extends the [Page](#/component/Page) component. Use this page to show the submission wizard. This makes use of the [SubmissionFilesListPanel](#/component/ListPanel/components/SubmissionFilesListPanel) and `<ContributorsListPanel>`. Add props for these components to the `components` prop.

```json
{
    "components": {
        "contributors": {...},
        "submissionFiles": {...}
    }
}
```

## Steps, Sections and Review

The `steps` property is an array of steps. Each step includes an id, name, an array of sections, and information about how these sections should be displayed in the review step.

```json
[
    {
        "id": "details",
        "name": "Details",
        "reviewName": "Details You Entered",
        "reviewTemplate": "/submission/review-details.tpl",
        "sections": [
            ...
        ]
    }
]
```

The `reviewTemplate` points to a [template file](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/documentation/en/frontend-pages#smarty) that can display the entered information on the review stage. This is not used in the browser, but is part of how the steps are defined for the server-side templates. Server-side templating is used so that plugins can make use of [template overrides](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/plugin-guide/en/templates) to customize the wizard.

All sections include a name and description, and must be one of the recognized types. The `contributors` type will display a `<ContributorsListPanel>`. It will pull the component's props from the `components.contributors` and `publication` props of this page.

```json
{
	"id": "contributors",
	"name": "Contributors",
	"description": "Please add all the contributors to this submission.",
	"type": "contributors" // APP\pages\submission\SubmissionHandler::SECTION_TYPE_CONTRIBUTORS
}
```

The `files` type will display a [SubmissionFilesListPanel](#/component/ListPanel/components/SubmissionFilesListPanel). It will pull the component's props from the `components.submissionFiles` props of this page.

```json
{
	"id": "files",
	"name": "Upload Files",
	"description": "Please upload all files our editorial staff need to evaluate your submission.",
	"type": "files" // APP\pages\submission\SubmissionHandler::SECTION_TYPE_FILES
}
```

The `form` type will display a [Form](#/component/Form) and autosave all changes to it. The form's props should be passed with the section.

```json
{
    "id": "details",
    "name": "Details",
    "description": "Please enter the title, abstract and other information about this submission.",
    "type": "form", // APP\pages\submission\SubmissionHandler::SECTION_TYPE_FORM
    "form": {
        ...
    }
}
```

The `confirm` type is a special type that is used in the review step to prevent the submission from being submitted before the author has confirmed the copyright notice. When used this way, the section id should be `confirmSubmission`. It will display a [Form](#/componentForm) that will not be autosaved. The form's props should be passed with the section.

```json
{
    "id": "confirmSubmission",
    "name": "Copyright Notice",
    "description": "Please agree to the copyright notice before submitting.",
    "type": "form", // APP\pages\submission\SubmissionHandler::SECTION_TYPE_CONFIRM
    "form": {
        ...
    }
}
```

The `review` type is a special type to show a review of the data. No configuration is needed, but if a section is added it will be displayed after the review.

```json
{
	"id": "review",
	"name": "Review",
	"description": "Please review this information before completing your submission.",
	"type": "review" // APP\pages\submission\SubmissionHandler::SECTION_TYPE_REVIEW
}
```

Other types can be created and added to the wizard by modifying the `wizard.tpl` template file or using the `Template::SubmissionWizard::Section` and `Template::SubmissionWizard::Section` hooks.

## Reconfigure Submission

Some submission properties like the language or section can only be changed through a special form. This appears at the top of the wizard, where it says something like "Submitting to the Articles section in English. These properties are changed separately from the rest of the wizard because they may effect the configuration of the wizard itself. Once the form is saved, the wizard is reloaded with the correct configuration for that section and language.

To map the values of this form to the correct API endpoint, you must set the `reconfigurePublicationProps` and `reconfigureSubmissionProps`. For example, the `sectionId` is a property of the `Publication`, but the `locale` is a property of the `Submission`. To ensure that each property is saved to the correct API endpoint, pass the following data to `<SubmissionWizardPage>`.

```json
{
	"reconfigurePublicationProps": ["sectionId"],
	"reconfigureSubmissionProps": ["locale"]
}
```

If more fields are added to the form, the properties must be added to these two props.
