# List

## Usage

Use this component to display simple lists of content that should be grouped together. If one list item uses an icon in the `value` slot, all items should use an icon in the `value` slot. The user should be able to scan from top to bottom with all text aligned vertically on the left.

<Primary />
<ArgTypes />
