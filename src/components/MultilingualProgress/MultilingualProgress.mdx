# Multilingual Progress

## Usage

Use this component to indicate progress towards completing items that are required in multiple languages.

## Recommendations

This is primarily intended for use with multilingual input fields, but can be used in other scenarios where we want to indicate to the user that a particular action should be completed in more than one locale.
