# SubmissionFilesListPanel

## Usage

Use this component to upload [Submission Files](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/documentation/en/submission-files). Every submission file must be assigned a genre, one of the file types configured by the journal, press or preprint server. The `genre` prop expects an array of file type ids, names and whether or not the genre is one of the primary file types. See the following example.

```json
[
	{
		"id": 1,
		"name": "Book Manuscript",
		"isPrimary": true
	},
	{
		"id": 2,
		"name": "Preface"
	}
]
```

<Primary />
<ArgTypes />
