# FileAttacher

## Usage

Use the `<FileAttacher>` to allow a user to upload a file or select a file that has already been uploaded. Each one of the "attachers" configures a different source of files for the `<FileAttacher>`. For example, to allow the user to attach a file from the publisher library, the `attachers` prop would add a `FileAttacherLibrary`.

```html
<FileAttacher
	:attachers="[
        {
            component: 'FileAttacherLibrary',
            label: 'Library Files',
            description: 'Attach files from the Submission and Publisher Libraries.',
            button: 'Attach Library Files',
            libraryApiUrl: 'http://example.org',
            includeSubmissionId: 15,
            attachSelectedLabel: 'Attach Selected',
            backLabel: 'Back',
            downloadLabel: 'Download'
        }
    ]"
/>
```
