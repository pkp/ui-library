# useFormChanged

The `useFormChanged` composable tracks whether a form has been modified (but not saved).  
It can be used to show a confirmation prompt before closing the form, preventing users from accidentally losing their work.

## Basic usage

Detect if the form state has changed:

```
const {hasStateChanged} = useFormChanged(
    form,
    additionalFields,
);
```

## Warn before closing

Enable a warning dialog if there are unsaved changes before:

- closing the browser tab
- closing a modal

Pass the option `warnOnClose: true` and an `onCloseFn` callback (called when the user confirms closing). This will automatically attach a `beforeunload` listener for browser tabs and register the close callback for modals.

```
const { confirmClose } = useFormChanged(
  form,
  additionalFields,
  onCloseFn,
  { warnOnClose: true }
);

```

You can then pass `confirmClose` as the @cancel handler in your Form component.
