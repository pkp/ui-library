# useLegacyGridUrl

This composable makes it easier to open legacy server-side modals. These modals are server-side rendered, so it's important to make a request to the correct URL and render the content which is returned.

Lots of examples can be seen across the code base. Often used when refactoring legacy grids to new Vue.js managers, where first legacy modals are reused and replaced over time.

```js
const {openLegacyModal} = useLegacyGridUrl({
	component: 'grid.notifications.taskNotificationsGridHandler',
	op: 'fetchGrid',
});

openLegacyModal({title: t('common.tasks')}, () => {
	updateIsTasksModalOpened(false);
});
```
