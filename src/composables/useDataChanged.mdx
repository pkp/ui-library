# useDataChanged

`useDataChangedProvider` and `useDataChanged` composables are used to notify other components about data changes on more complex pages.

Currently, this approach is used on the [Workflow](../?path=/docs/pages-workflow--docs) page.

Workflow page store is responsible for fetching submission & publication objects as these are essential and useful also for many components on the page. In addition, there are multiple managers that are fetching additional data. ParticipantManager is fetching a list of participants. FileManagers are fetching a list of files. And whatever changes these managers make can impact data in the submission/publication.

The following mechanism is used to ensure all data on the page stays up to date. If page/manager knows that data might have changed, the given page/manager store will notify about that using the `useDataChanged` composable. And that gives the opportunity to other stores to reload data that they own.

## useDataChangedProvider

`workflow` store is responsible for managing state for the workflow page (it's rendered within a modal, but still considered an independent page). It's the right place for the `useDataChangedProvider`, which is a coordinator of the data changes happening on that page.

```js
const {triggerDataChange} = useDataChangedProvider(() => {
	// when the data change is triggered, it refetches submission and publication
	return refetchSubmissionPublication();
});
```

## useDataChanged

For example, in ParticipantManager, which is rendered on the workflow page, the `useDataChanged` composable is used. It connects with the `useDataChangedProvider` using `provide/inject` to connect to the closest `useDataChangedProvider` parent.

```js
// when any other store triggers data change, this store is responsible for refetching participants
const {triggerDataChange} = useDataChanged(() => fetchParticipants());
```
