# useExtender

`useExtender` is used to explicitly expose configuration functions, which makes extensibility from plugins a lot simpler. How to tap into these extensions from plugins is covered in [Plugin Guide](..?path=/docs/guide-plugins--docs).

If you are building a page/manager that makes sense to make configurable/extensible - check out for example how the `useExtender` is used in [ParticipantManager](../?path=/docs/managers-participantmanager--docs).
