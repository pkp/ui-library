# useForm

The purpose of `useForm` is to make client-side manipulation with forms easier, without traversing directly the form configuration structure.

It's already useful for scenarios like getting/setting values and other form properties on the client side. Created to address some use cases in 3.5, but it's in a very early stage and is expected to mature during the 3.6 release cycle. Also, breaking changes are to be expected. But even in this stage, it's still better than manipulating form structure directly.
