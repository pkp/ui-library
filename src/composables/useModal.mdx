# useModal

## openDialog

Dialogs provide a quick way to show a simple confirmation prompt. Import `useModal` composable and use the openDialog() method to create a dialog.

```html
<template>
	<PkpButton @click="openWarningDialog">Open Dialog</PkpButton>
</template>

<script setup>
	import {useModal} from '@/composables/useModal';

	const {openDialog} = useModal();

	function openWarningDialog() {
		openDialog({
			name: 'example',
			title: 'Submit Article',
			message: 'Are you sure you want to submit this article?',
			actions: [
				{
					label: 'Yes',
					isPrimary: true,
					callback: (close) => {
						// user has confirmed
						close();
					},
				},
				{
					label: 'No',
					isWarnable: true,
					callback: (close) => {
						// user has cancelled. close the modal
						close();
					},
				},
			],
			close: () => {
				// dialog has been closed
			},
		});
	}
</script>
```

## openSideModal

SideModal should be created as separate component, follow examples from [SideModal](../?path=/docs/components-sidemodal--docs) component, where `openSideModal()` is also used to control the SideModals.

Once you have the SideModal component created just pass the component as first argument and its props as second argument.

Alternatively its possible to pass component name if its globally registered.

```javascript

<script setup>
	import SummaryModal from '@/pages/submissions/summaryModal.vue'
	const {openSideModal} = useModal();
	function openModal() {
		openSideModal(SummaryModal, {someProp: 5});
	}
</script>

```
