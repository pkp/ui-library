						'<p>We sincerely thank all reviewers for their thorough and constructive feedback on our revised manuscript. We have carefully addressed each concern raised:</p><p><strong>Regarding the sample size concerns (Dr. Wei):</strong> We have added a detailed power analysis in the Methods section (lines 145-152) demonstrating that our sample size of n=128 provides 85% power to detect the expected effect size based on preliminary data.</p><p><strong>Regarding Figure 3 clarity (Dr. Patel):</strong> We have completely redesigned Figure 3 with higher resolution (now 600 DPI) and clearer labeling. A color-blind friendly palette has also been implemented.</p><p><strong>Regarding limitations discussion:</strong> We have expanded the Discussion section (lines 312-328) to more thoroughly address the limitations of our study, including potential selection bias and the generalizability of our findings.</p><p>We believe these revisions have substantially strengthened the manuscript and hope the reviewers will find our responses satisfactory.</p>',
