# User Invitation Manager

This table displays the current list of outstanding user invitations and allows the journal manager to edit and cancel user invitations. It consists of an invitation to a role button that leads to the user invitation workflow. Invitations for both new and existing users to add roles are listed with modal links to edit and cancel the pending invitations.
