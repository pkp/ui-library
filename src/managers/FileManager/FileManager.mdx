The name of the Pinia store is `FileManager_NAMESPACE`. Given that there are cases when there are multiple FileManagers displayed at once, the Pinia store needs to have a unique name - every type of FileManager has its own namespace: `SUBMISSION_FILES`, `EDITOR_REVIEW_FILES`, `WORKFLOW_REVIEW_REVISIONS`, `COPYEDITED_FILES`, `FINAL_DRAFT_FILES`, `PRODUCTION_READY_FILES`

- `getTopItems`: Add/Change items in the top right, where the `Order` button is.
- `getBottomItems`: Add/Change items in the top right, where the `Add File` button is.
- `getItemActions`: Add/Change the list of actions that are displayed after clicking the 3 dots button.
- `getColumns`: Add/Change the columns being displayed in the table.
- `getManagerConfig`: FileManager configuration for the given NAMESPACE. It's an unlikely use case to adjust that from a plugin, but it's available.
