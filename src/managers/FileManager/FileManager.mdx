## Extension points for plugins

For more details and examples how to use them, check out [Plugins guide](..?path=/docs/guide-plugins--docs)

Name of the pinia store is `FileManager_NAMESPACE`. Given that there are cases when there is multiple FileManagers displayed at once and pinia store needs to have unique name - every type of FileManager has its own namespace: `SUBMISSION_FILES`, `EDITOR_REVIEW_FILES`, `WORKFLOW_REVIEW_REVISIONS`, `COPYEDITED_FILES`, `FINAL_DRAFT_FILES`, `PRODUCTION_READY_FILES`

- `getTopItems`: Add/Change items in top right, where the `Order` button is.
- `getBottomItems`: Add/Change items in top right, where the `Add File` button is.
- `getItemActions`: Add/Change list of actions that are displayed after clicking 3 dots button.
- `getColumns`: Add/Change the columns being displayed in the table.
- `getManagerConfig`: FileManager configuration for given NAMESPACE. Its unlikely use case to adjusting that from plugin, but its available.
