The name of the Pinia store is `DiscussionManager`.

- `getTopItems`: Add/Change items in the top right, where the `Seach` and `Add` buttons are.
- `getBottomItems`: Add/Change items in the bottom left of the table.
- `getItemActions`: Add/Change the list of actions that are displayed after clicking the 3 dots button.
- `getColumns`: Add/Change the columns being displayed in the table.
- `getManagerConfig`: DiscussionManager configuration. It's unlikely to use that for adjusting from a plugin, but it's available.
